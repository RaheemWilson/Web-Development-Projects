# Web-Development-Projects
The following are projects that I have completed whilst learning web developement. 

They are:
  1. A weather application that is developed to provide weather forecast for all the parishes in Jamaica over a five day period. 
  2. A modified version of the hangman game logic where I used trivial questions for the users to answer instead of plain words. 
  3. A barbershop website that tested my skills using Flask in creating forms as wells routing.
